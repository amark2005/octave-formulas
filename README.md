GNU Octave Computational Notes - [ x ]
This repository contains a collection of GNU Octave (.m) scripts developed for learning, experimentation, and validation of mathematical and engineering-style calculations.

The goal is to build a reusable, transparent, and verifiable codebase for numerical reasoning and early-stage modeling.
Objective

    Develop proficiency in GNU Octave for numerical computation.

    Translate mathematical formulas into executable programs.

    Explore conditional logic, iteration, and parameter sweeps.

    Maintain a reference library for future analytical and engineering work.

Scope

The repository includes scripts related to:

    Basic numerical calculations.

    Loop-based evaluations across parameter ranges.

    Conditional decision logic.

    Simple physical and mathematical models.

The focus is on clarity, correctness, and reproducibility, not optimization.
Usage

Option 1: Run from the terminal
Bash

octave filename.m

Option 2: Run from within the Octave environment
Matlab

run("filename.m")

    Note: Each script is intended to be self-contained.

Design Principles

    Readable and minimal code: Prioritizing understanding over brevity.

    Explicit variable naming: Clear definitions for physical constants.

    No hidden dependencies: Standalone execution.

    Extensible: Suitable for incremental extension and refactoring.

Intended Use

    Learning and revision.

    Quick numerical verification.

    Prototyping analytical ideas.

    Reference for future modeling or simulation work.

Repository Status

    Active learning repository. Scripts may change as understanding improves.
